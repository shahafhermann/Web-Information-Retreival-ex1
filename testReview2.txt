review/text:    I 
have bought several  of the Vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality $	

     










. 
The product looks more like 

a stew than a processed 


meat and it smells better. 

My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most.

the peanuts were actually small sized unsalted

review/summary: "Delight" says it all
review/text: This is a confection that has been around a few centuries.  It is a light, pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts - in this case Filberts. And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar.  And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven.  Not too chewy, and very flavorful.  I highly recommend this yummy treat.  If you are familiar with the story of C.S. Lewis' "The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe" - this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch.
