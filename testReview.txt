review/summary: Good Quality Dog Food
review/text: I have bought several of the Vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality. 
The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better. My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than most. My. finicky finicky smell be,don't!
