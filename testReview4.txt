review/summary: Good Quality Dog Food
review/text: I have bought several of the Vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good 


quality. The product looks 
more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better. My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most.

review/summary: Not as Advertised
review/text: 

Product arrived labeled as Jumbo Salted Peanuts...the peanuts were actually small sized unsalted. Not sure if this was an 
error or if the vendor intended to represent the product 
as "Jumbo".
